These instructions assume you have docker installed on your machine, and properly pulled the current GitHub repository.

1. Create the Docker Container
	a) Open up a terminal window
	b) Navigate to the flask-app directory (cd ~/CSC395_Team-5/flask-app)
	c) Once inside the directory, run the following commands:
		- docker build -t python-web-server
		- docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/app:/app python-web-server
	d) docker run will freeze you inside the terminal. To proceed, hit 'CTRL +C' to quit
	e) If you run 'docker ps', your container will not show up as it is no longer running. If you run 'docker ps -a '. Your container should be there under the name 'python-web-server' and show that the container was exited. 
	f) Now you need to start the container again. Type 'docker run python-web-server' into the terminal
	g) If you run 'docker ps' again, it should now show the container. 
	
2. Install ngrok

3. Open the port
	a) Open up a terminal window
	b) run the command 'ngrok http 5000'
